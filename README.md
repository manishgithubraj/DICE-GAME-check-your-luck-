Dice games can be played with different variations and rules, but here is a general description for a simple dice game:

Name: Roll & Score

Objective: The objective of the game is to score the most points by rolling the dice and collecting different combinations.

Players: The game can be played with 2 or more players.

Materials: The game requires five six-sided dice, a scorecard or a sheet of paper, and a pen or pencil.

Rules:

Each player takes turns rolling all five dice.

After each roll, the player must set aside at least one die and can choose to reroll the remaining dice up to two more times to improve their score.

The player scores points based on the combination of the dice they have set aside. The following combinations are scored:

Three of a kind: Three dice showing the same number score the total of all five dice.
Four of a kind: Four dice showing the same number score the total of all five dice.
Five of a kind: All five dice showing the same number score 50 points.
Full House: Three dice showing one number and two dice showing another number score 25 points.
Straight: Five sequential numbers (e.g., 1-2-3-4-5 or 2-3-4-5-6) score 40 points.
Chance: Any combination of dice can be scored. The total of all five dice is added to the player's score.
The player writes their score on the scorecard and passes the dice to the next player.

The game ends when all players have taken their turns, and the player with the highest score wins.
